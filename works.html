        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p id="para"> I am Astha Dwivedi, doing web devlopement with a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. I have developed key skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating dynamic, responsive user interfaces, while my proficiency with PHP and MySQL allows me to build robust and scalable web applications. Additionally, I have basic knowledge of Java and am comfortable with Python, which helps me with problem-solving and further strengthens my programming abilities.

            In terms of my project experience, I have successfully developed a portfolio website that showcases my capabilities in web development. This website includes essential features such as navigation bars for the home, about, and contact sections. The contact form is integrated with a database, demonstrating my understanding of backend connectivity and how to work with databases effectively.
            
            Another project I worked on is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. This project utilizes a JavaScript modal form to enhance the user experience, with PHP serving as the backend. The app allows for seamless functionality across various database operations, showcasing my ability to manage data-centric web applications efficiently. <br>
            
            Currently, I am working on an e-commerce website, which provides me with an opportunity to further expand my skills by tackling a more complex and real-world project. Through this, I am gaining valuable experience in areas like user interaction, inventory management, and backend operations such as payment gateways.
            
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSc CS) in my third year at Shaheed Padmadhar Singh Government Autonomous PG College in Satna, Madhya Pradesh. Academically, I have always performed well, scoring 95.6% in my 10th-grade exams and 84.4% in my 12th-grade exams, both under the Madhya Pradesh Board.
            
            In my spare time, I enjoy reading, writing, and drawing, which helps me stay creative and well-rounded. These hobbies complement my technical skills and allow me to approach problem-solving and innovation from both an analytical and creative perspective.
            <br>
            Overall, my technical expertise, hands-on project experience, and strong academic background make me a driven web developer, eager to take on new challenges and continue growing in the tech industry.</p>
